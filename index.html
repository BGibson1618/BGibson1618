						<div class="content">
							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>After spending several years in restaurant management and finding it ultimately unfulfilling, I decided it was time 
								to find a career I could truly be passionate about. To that end, I re-enrolled in college and earned a bachelor's 
								degree in computer science. I am now looking for employment in the tech field so I can start the next chapter
								of my life.
							</p>
							<p>While I am extremely happy with the education I received at Cal State, there is only so much one can learn in the 
								classroom. I am now working to identify where my education is lacking and finding the resources needed to 
								learn the relevant skills. Currently, I am taking online courses to become more proficient with git and GitHub and 
								learn to use the advanced debugging features of my favorite IDE's as well as continuing to work on two projects from
								my senior year at CSUN.
							</p>
								<p>While my work experience in tech is on par with other recent graduates, I believe the management 
								experience and communication skills I honed in the service industry, combined with my natural aptitude for logical thinking
								and love of problem solving, allow me to bring a unique tool set to the table.

							<h1>Education</h1>
							<h2>California State University, Northridge</h2>
							<h3>Computer Science</h3>
							<p>Having completed my lower division courses at SMC, I was able to get into more advanced classes at CSUN. The 
								computer science degree path at CSUN exposed me to a diverse set of programming languages including Prolog, Java,
								and Swift, but the languages I gained the most proficiency with were Python, C#, and C. <br>
								GPA: 3.72, Dean's List
							</p>

							<h2>Santa Monica College</h2>
							<h3>Computer Science</h3>
							<p>At SMC, I took lower division computer science and general education courses. I earned what they refer to as a 
								Certificate of Achievement in Computer Science and was able to transfer to Cal State, Northridge to complete my
								bachelor's degree. <br>
								GPA: 3.56, Deans Honor List

							<h1>Current Projects</h1>
							<p>Below are two projects which began as group projects during my senior year at CSUN. They have now become personal
								ventures that I continue to work on as a way to learn new programming techniques. A brief description of each 
								is provided along with a link to a website if you would like a more in-depth look.

							<h2>VR Drums</h2>
							<p>Current research overwhelmingly shows the benefits of music education for children. Unfortunately, music and arts
								are often the first things that get cut from the curriculum when a school district finds itself short on funding.
								The VR Drums project aims to create a cheap, portable, and quiet means of keeping music education in the classroom.

							<h2>Kinetic Radiance</h2>
							<p>In recent years, the market for products that enourage mindfulness and relaxation has proven to be substantial. Adult
								coloring books, apps that offer guided meditation, and YouTube channels streaming videos of peaceful locales remain
								in high demand. Kinetic Radiance combines music and visually stunning effects in a virtual reality environment to
								offer the user an easily accessible escape from reality that engages the senses.
