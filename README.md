- 👋 Hi, I’m Brent Gibson. 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Finding a job in which I can put my years of management experience and love of programming to good use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... All the things they didn't teach me in college. I am taking courses on [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) to become more proficient with git and GitHub, how to use my favorite IDE's more productively (JetBrains ftw), and how to debug code like a pro. I am also continuing to work on two projects from my last semester at [CSUN](http://www.csun.edu) which are pushing me to learn more about C# scripting and developing with Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anythying involving Unity, especially if it's in the VR/AR space. I also really enjoy low-level embedded systems programming in C, and I never say no to Python.
